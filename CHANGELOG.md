  ([#37](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/37),
  [`e016b6c`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/e016b6c49c38af55666357d8c18fa8d456b7bca5))


## v0.48.0 (2026-05-14)

### Bug Fixes

- Address crossfire review findings in session-search skill
  ([#32](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/32),
  [`8f162ad`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/8f162ad58167014cef298810cc8ae78cee698f55))

### Features

- Add cross-agent session search skill ([#32](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/32),
  [`8f162ad`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/8f162ad58167014cef298810cc8ae78cee698f55))

### Testing

- Add fixture-based tests for session search skill
  ([#32](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/32),
  [`8f162ad`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/8f162ad58167014cef298810cc8ae78cee698f55))


## v0.47.12 (2026-05-14)

### Bug Fixes

- Address code review findings for parallel plan/apply
  ([#36](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/36),
  [`76f4c83`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/76f4c830af1b5f38fa52bb662415c4bdca0b1c5c))

- Use subclasses instead of instance assignment for ClassVar component_id
  ([#36](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/36),
  [`76f4c83`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/76f4c830af1b5f38fa52bb662415c4bdca0b1c5c))

### Continuous Integration

- Sync publish workflow
  ([`59f8b4c`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/59f8b4cda2b0cbe85b2bf1536dc577887db1b03c))

### Refactoring

- Add parallel plan/apply architecture for CLI components
  ([#36](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/36),
  [`76f4c83`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/76f4c830af1b5f38fa52bb662415c4bdca0b1c5c))


## v0.47.11 (2026-05-13)

### Bug Fixes

- Add build_command to PSR config so uv.lock stays in sync
  ([#34](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/34),
  [`af9ddaf`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/af9ddafb93459a8a935ae2ff6d5df107c2074848))

- Install uv in PSR Docker container before lockfile sync
  ([#35](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/35),
  [`c169040`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/c169040a688d31ce9ed66859e9c44ddf34ea9f59))

- **codex**: Remove commit_attribution from managed config
  ([#33](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/33),
  [`18b64ca`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/18b64ca965c363945922d361fabe05e638bb3249))


## v0.47.10 (2026-05-13)

### Bug Fixes

- Add PSR v10 changelog insertion flag and backfill missing entries
  ([#31](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/31),
  [`3df0522`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/3df052208f38c438bd8a974414283b2438aed441))


## v0.47.9 (2026-05-13)

### Bug Fixes

- Remove mkdir side effects from cache path getters
  ([`2a00cc9`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/2a00cc92c8c31ccca9637bc6713e5bd8b51a2816))

get_merged_settings_path() and get_cache_dir() created directories as a side effect of being
  called. When goose's settings file was excluded, SettingsComponent would clean up the orphaned
  cache/goose/ dir, then ConfigComponent would recreate it by accessing GooseAgent.symlinks (which
  calls get_settings_file_for_symlink → get_merged_settings_path).

The only caller that writes to the cache (build_merged_settings) already creates the directory
  independently.


## v0.47.8 (2026-05-13)

### Refactoring

- Remove dead code and wire up ToolSpec.is_enabled filtering
  ([#30](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/30),
  [`3622e06`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/3622e06b5b78e018c05f5de61fc431a238d6c641))

Drop zero-caller helpers/exports, unused kwargs, and dead guards. Filter ToolSpec.is_enabled in
  upgrade.py when no --only is set; extract _filter_enabled helper and rewrite
  TestIsEnabledFiltering to exercise it.


## v0.47.7 (2026-05-11)

### Bug Fixes

- Re-enable automatic CHANGELOG generation
  ([#29](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/29),
  [`8a8a65e`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/8a8a65e3e44ba92ec183bd233beba0145afbb2d3))

PSR v10 requires an explicit [tool.semantic_release.changelog] section — v9 generated changelogs
  by default. The dependabot-driven v9→v10 upgrade (3ca3c0f) silently dropped CHANGELOG updates for
  v0.47.3 through v0.47.6. Backfills all four missing versions.


## v0.47.6 (2026-05-11)

### Bug Fixes

- Bash tab completion broken for ai-rules alias
  ([#28](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/28),
  [`b2f78b9`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/b2f78b96061787b8d95977c3e806ffb737696cf5))

Click derives the completion env var from prog_name, which defaults to sys.argv[0]. The completion
  function re-invokes the CLI with $1 set to the command being completed — when that's "ai-rules",
  Click looks for _AI_RULES_COMPLETE instead of _AI_AGENT_RULES_COMPLETE, never enters completion
  mode, and dumps the help text. Fix by adding an entrypoint wrapper that passes complete_var
  explicitly. Also commits uv.lock for CI parity and adds a completion regression test.


## v0.47.5 (2026-05-11)

### Bug Fixes

- Enable recall KB write-back with Stop hook and imperative AGENTS.md
  ([#27](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/27),
  [`ff78283`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/ff78283f7de0b31e57d6363806d7d15ab2e7d767))

Recall MCP had zero new notes written despite working correctly — the AGENTS.md instruction used
  advisory language that the agent deprioritized. Strengthened write-back language to mandatory with
  explicit triggers, added a conservative Stop hook as safety net, and fixed preserved_fields cache
  bug where dict fields like hooks were unconditionally overwritten.

### Chores

- **deps**: Bump actions/create-github-app-token from 2 to 3
  ([#24](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/24),
  [`2c25163`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/2c251637cfda0406bef876a2485932ead2451153))

- **deps**: Bump astral-sh/setup-uv from 3 to 7
  ([#23](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/23),
  [`58bff4b`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/58bff4bedd20395b20a88aec10853b2125d49d7b))


## v0.47.4 (2026-05-08)

### Refactoring

- Semantic component categories and --only filtering
  ([#18](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/18),
  [`8761ba1`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/8761ba108da0b8dd54199b94233ba102436d662e))

Components were organized by mechanism (SymlinkComponent handled all symlinks) rather than by what
  users care about (config files, skills, settings, MCPs). Reorganized into semantic categories with
  --only filtering support, two-phase install runner, and extensions component for agents/commands/hooks.

### Bug Fixes

- Remove [skip ci] from release commit template
  ([#25](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/25),
  [`58278e4`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/58278e4d9d2a07a29151959369846a0ab9dd8910))

[skip ci] in release commits poisons CI for any PR that updates from main — GitHub skips
  pull_request workflows when any commit in the push range contains [skip ci].


## v0.47.3 (2026-05-08)

### Bug Fixes

- Use correct dependabot commit-message prefix
  ([#22](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/22),
  [`c4fdd13`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/c4fdd13265c8dfcda910c29887a656038b9cc611))

prefix: "chore(deps)" combined with include: "scope" produced chore(deps)(deps): — Dependabot
  appends (scope) to the prefix. Using prefix: "chore" lets include: "scope" add (deps) naturally.

- Add allow_zero_version and remove bogus commit_type_map
  ([`4e22412`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/4e22412f71c338a37e512b9f9682811f2efd4d41))

PSR v10 changed the default for allow_zero_version from true to false, causing the 0.47.2 → 1.0.0
  bump. commit_type_map was never a valid PSR config key — silently ignored in both v9 and v10.

### Chores

- **deps**: Bump dependabot/fetch-metadata from 2 to 3
  ([#17](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/17),
  [`2848352`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/2848352db6427b0a6371867854661326bb157690))

- **deps**: Bump python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release
  ([#16](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/16),
  [`3ca3c0f`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/3ca3c0f14f35aebdd8a4f727158956e1b0c626df))

- **deps**: Bump actions/checkout from 4 to 6
  ([#15](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/15),
  [`c139207`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/c1392075859f3b16769065e482e2568ada081e65))


## v0.47.2 (2026-05-08)

### Bug Fixes

- Auto-create dependencies label in automerge workflow
  ([#21](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/21),
  [`2d9aece`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/2d9aece4ec2a6d168ddd8d776cac239ae87dfee5))

Dependabot doesn't auto-create labels referenced in dependabot.yml — it skips labeling and leaves a
  comment asking you to create it manually. Adding a self-healing step that creates the label if
  missing so the golden path works on new repos without manual setup.

- Prevent cascading CI/release runs on version commits
  ([#20](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/20),
  [`6dbea90`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/6dbea90509cd430f7d9611af66a9b6694fca0cd4))

PSR pushes a release commit to main, which triggers CI, which triggers another Automated Release run
  (no-op but wasteful). Adding [skip ci] to the release commit message prevents the cascade at the
  source.

### Chores

- **deps)(deps**: Bump actions/setup-python from 5 to 6
  ([#14](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/14),
  [`08ff390`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/08ff3904aa441d04c92dd5f58b701bcaa318262c))

## v0.47.1 (2026-05-08)

### Bug Fixes

- Increase crossfire review agent timeout threshold
  ([`9d2408f`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/9d2408fbeef0da02d92828af841d7e6de95bd7d3))

Seeing this regularly get exceeded for medium/large complexity reviews

### Chores

- Enhance dependabot automation and workflow hygiene
  ([#12](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/12),
  [`58d4fe7`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/58d4fe74cf5c46c8f2b04cb33248517a6612dc1a))

* chore: enhance dependabot config and add auto-merge workflow

Default dependabot config only covered uv with no customizations — GitHub Actions versions were
  never updated, every minor/patch bump created its own PR, and commit messages didn't follow
  conventional commit format. For a solo-maintained project, grouped updates with auto-merge
  eliminates the most manual toil.

Renames CI job from test→ci to better reflect its scope.

* chore: add least-privilege permissions to all workflows

CodeQL flags workflows without explicit permissions blocks since they inherit the default token
  scope (overly broad). CI and publish only need read access; release needs write for GitHub
  releases and workflow dispatch.

* chore: standardize workflow check names for cleaner GitHub UI

Redundant job `name:` fields and mismatched job IDs made GitHub checks read awkwardly (`CI / CI`,
  `Automated Release / Release`). Convention: workflow `name:` is the category, job ID describes the
  action.

Post-merge: update branch protection required check from `CI` to `checks`.

- Migrate release workflow to GitHub App token auth
  ([#19](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/19),
  [`193133c`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/193133c5e68d0f5861a0a8da6040897e206614dd))

python-semantic-release couldn't push version commits to main because classic branch protection
  doesn't support bypass actors on personal repos. Switched to a GitHub App (wpfleger-release-bot)
  with repository rulesets bypass, replacing the SSH deploy key + GITHUB_TOKEN pattern.

Also simplifies publish workflow: replaces workflow_dispatch trigger (workaround for unreliable
  on:workflow_run) with on:release which fires reliably when PSR creates a GitHub Release via the
  API. This removes the tag validation boilerplate since the release event guarantees a valid tag
  exists.

- **release**: 0.47.1
  ([`c35b94f`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/c35b94f32cc19e5d2b3aef60c61d4601b623d3d5))

### Refactoring

- Split CLI around static component registries
  ([#11](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/pull/11),
  [`e0925ba`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/e0925ba56a926b201db0ed41ea792c56e7d5eb27))

The CLI had become the integration point for every managed lifecycle concern, which made omissions
  across install, status, diff, and uninstall easy. This keeps the existing target abstractions
  while moving lifecycle behavior behind ordered registries and explicit command registration.


## v0.47.0 (2026-05-07)

### Chores

- **release**: 0.47.0
  ([`a87ca3c`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/a87ca3c12b3c32ae96eadba49d41028f1f88c9c6))

### Features

- Re-enable clear context option on plan accept
  ([`84334ce`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/84334ce8a7bf4a5aaa3b3b30b86e1c52845444a5))

showClearContextOnPlanAccept defaulted to false as of Claude Code v2.1.81, hiding the "clear
  context" choice from the plan approval dialog. Explicitly set to true so the option is available
  again.


## v0.46.0 (2026-05-06)

### Chores

- **release**: 0.46.0
  ([`d438582`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/d43858237db10dc96344aa2ec5280ead05166dc0))

### Features

- Release recall MCP
  ([`07b4e38`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/07b4e38c5f5830b601484f903c2e53cd47a413fb))


## v0.45.1 (2026-05-06)

### Bug Fixes

- Codex config drift
  ([`b8df839`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/b8df8397547172ad25108a12fbd6c3079f7a2257))

### Chores

- **release**: 0.45.1
  ([`fe5c0d1`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/fe5c0d1ea2af6fdddaf2186c0f8bcd895a3e47e9))


## v0.45.0 (2026-05-06)

### Chores

- **release**: 0.45.0
  ([`0129036`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/0129036465eedd2e2dea42b187874e5e31308eb2))

### Features

- **codex**: Switch managed Codex default to gpt-5.5
  ([`2caad8e`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/2caad8ecc2f5698ff4928a5bacbdb2048d1164ae))

OpenAI now recommends gpt-5.5 for Codex when it is available, and our managed Codex setups use
  ChatGPT sign-in where that model is supported. This keeps the bundled default aligned with current
  Codex guidance while preserving the existing reasoning defaults until we benchmark a separate
  retune.


## v0.44.0 (2026-05-04)

### Chores

- **release**: 0.44.0
  ([`485e9f8`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/485e9f81658fea4b4df56150e4e5716dbbed0ee8))

### Features

- Add multi-agent orchestration to AGENTS.md and code-reviewer
  ([`b727399`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/b727399ea57867188581930e26c0c089f6e02bd3))

Single-agent code reviews accumulate context contamination across lenses — Anthropic's production
  data shows 90.2% quality improvement with multi-agent delegation. The code-reviewer applied all
  four lenses sequentially in one context window with crossfire awkwardly bolted on as a separate
  Phase 0/5 wrapper duplicating ~100 lines of bash.

AGENTS.md gains a Delegation & Multi-Agent Orchestration section with quantitative triggers,
  self-containment briefing protocol, synthesis discipline, and anti-patterns. Code-reviewer gains
  complexity-based routing: small diffs stay inline, medium/large diffs spawn 3 parallel Claude
  subagents (Security, Design, Functionality) with optional crossfire dispatched in the same
  parallel batch — replacing the old 6-phase structure with a cleaner 3-phase flow.

- Add skill browsing/sharing CLI and standardize tool subcommands
  ([`d99267e`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/d99267e85613144b3d0927ebcfd856afcf3a5a6a))

Skills buried at src/ai_rules/config/skills/ were hard to discover and share. New `skill list` and
  `skill show` commands let users browse skills from the terminal and generate GitHub URLs for
  sharing.

Also consolidates tool management: `info` replaced by `tool list`, `tool source` refactored from
  positional dispatch to named subcommands (list/get/set) matching the pattern used by other CLI
  groups.


## v0.43.1 (2026-04-30)

### Bug Fixes

- Derive MCP preserved fields dynamically from MCPManager
  ([`7f06845`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/7f06845ab9c2b4c7e737b22bf89446d85156ba12))

Codex's mcp_settings_key ("mcp_servers") and mcp_tracking_key ("_ai_agent_rules_managed") weren't in
  preserved_fields, so get_cache_diff still produced false-positive diffs after the MCP/cache
  unification — the same class of bug fixed for Amp and Gemini.

Rather than manually adding MCP keys to each agent's preserved_fields (which is fragile and caused
  the Codex omission), adds an _effective_preserved_fields property that dynamically extends the
  static list with MCP keys from the agent's MCPManager. Also guards _merge_managed_mcps against
  non-dict MCP entries, and restores dim ALREADY_INSTALLED output with per-agent labels.

- Unify MCP and settings pipelines in cache build
  ([`d0d48bd`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/d0d48bdf6917383d85be8ba07bd5178bdb7e8074))

Two independent pipelines (build_merged_settings and install_mcps) wrote to the same agent config
  files without coordination, causing status to show false-positive diffs for amp, codex, and
  gemini. The cache now represents the complete expected file state by merging managed MCPs during
  build_merged_settings via a _merge_managed_mcps hook.

Also fixes: MCP install output missing per-agent labels, amp settings.json formatting mismatch, tool
  install output appearing before profile header, Claude Code UI settings (skipAutoPermissionPrompt)
  lost on cache rebuild, and work profile model variant (opus vs opus[1m]).

### Chores

- **release**: 0.43.1

## v0.43.0 (2026-04-30)

### Bug Fixes

- Address review feedback for local install source
  ([`3bab6bd`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/3bab6bd4fbdb3e115a676407183f5baeaff73d4c))

perform_tool_upgrade() fell through to the PyPI upgrade path for LOCAL-sourced tools, which would
  silently overwrite the local install. Also fixes relative paths being stored verbatim in config —
  now resolved to absolute before persisting.

### Chores

- **release**: 0.43.0
  ([`7596f22`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/7596f2219e8f5e33b599bf4dce747203de4f4103))

### Features

- Add generic local install source for managed tools
  ([`5140b3f`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/5140b3f91a40c6575bc5fa97d2f4024fe1c06588))

Adds ToolSource.LOCAL alongside PYPI and GITHUB for all managed tools (ai-agent-rules, statusline,
  and any future tools like recall).

- install_tool() accepts local_path parameter for local filesystem installs -
  get_effective_install_source() returns (ToolSource, local_path) tuple - tool source CLI accepts
  "local:~/path" format with path validation - check_tool_updates() skips LOCAL-sourced tools (no
  remote to query) - ensure_statusline_installed() handles three-way source switching


## v0.42.0 (2026-04-24)

### Chores

- **release**: 0.42.0
  ([`fd508ea`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/fd508ea1504f136e818b50b83809ff40988371f6))

### Features

- Add per-tool install source configuration (PyPI vs GitHub)
  ([`1325c12`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/1325c1291e25af9b14490aa094a7812731b08a7d))

The --github flag on `setup` was ineffective for managed tools like statusline — if a tool was ever
  installed from PyPI, it stayed on PyPI forever regardless of flags or profile config. Three bugs
  conspired: `ensure_statusline_installed` ignored `from_github` when already installed, `setup`
  only source-switched ai-rules itself, and `upgrade` had no source override.

Adds profile-based install source config (`managed_tools.install_sources`) following the established
  pattern where profiles set defaults and user config overrides. Resolution priority: CLI `--github`
  flag > user config > active profile > default (PyPI). Includes source-switching support in
  `ensure_statusline_installed`, a new `tool source` subcommand for user config escape hatch, and
  drift detection in `info` output. Removes redundant `STATUSLINE_GITHUB_REPO` constant and
  hardcoded fallback in `install_tool()`. Fixes mock type bug in test_bootstrap_updater.


## v0.41.0 (2026-04-24)

### Chores

- Remove vestigial trigger-keywords and trigger-patterns from skills
  ([`4cbebea`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/4cbebea961a67149096248e5f13ffd372d620f61))

These custom metadata fields were added to feed a UserPromptSubmit hook (skillRouter.py) that was
  removed in 8ebee1b. Nothing reads them — skill activation relies on the description field in
  frontmatter.

- **release**: 0.41.0
  ([`efdf274`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/efdf274012bc8477cf781b4fc12743ad854d2f84))

### Features

- Add research skill, improve context for code-reviewer and crossfire
  ([`bc9db66`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/bc9db6654f3babe310885b08226222af0cda8b45))

Multi-agent research orchestrator adapted from Anthropic's deep research architecture. Opus
  orchestrates (query classification, planning, synthesis), Sonnet subagents execute in parallel
  with independent contexts. Tiered complexity routing scales from inline answers to 10 parallel
  agents.

Removed `context: fork` from research and code-reviewer skills so both retain conversation history
  -- fixes "investigate this" failing in research and reviewer missing design intent context. Added
  repo exploration instructions to crossfire prompts so external CLI agents (Codex, Gemini) read
  changed files and dependencies before reviewing, preventing false positives from missing codebase
  context.


## v0.40.1 (2026-04-23)

### Bug Fixes

- Detect and reinstall missing tools during upgrade
  ([`014543a`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/014543a25268e00b19960f3cbced25d62dbcb460))

`ai-rules upgrade` silently skipped tools that were uninstalled externally (e.g. `uv tool
  uninstall`) because the is_installed() filter dropped them with no warning. Since ai-agent-rules
  itself always passes is_installed(), the empty-list guard never fired.

### Chores

- **release**: 0.40.1
  ([`5b1a030`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/5b1a03056d2c781883d5840c80e2d5fd3aebe1ea))


## v0.40.0 (2026-04-23)

### Chores

- Delete unused script
  ([`390d1aa`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/390d1aa751e249d6a65eb1dce7d30d08f619c942))

- **release**: 0.40.0
  ([`554ae01`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/554ae01a567c87e4c1e19a12a737adb93d9e45ea))

### Features

- Add ConfigTarget hierarchy and StatuslineTool for managed tool configs
  ([`d40c319`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/d40c319695a0f4206170126d21d8feae9003672d))

The Agent ABC mixed config pipeline concerns (merge, cache, symlink) with agent-specific concerns
  (MCPs, skills). claude-code-status-line needed both config management and install lifecycle, but
  these were handled by two disconnected registries.

ConfigTarget is the new base owning the config pipeline. Agent and Tool are siblings: Agent adds
  MCP/skills, Tool adds optional ToolSpec for install lifecycle. StatuslineTool is the single source
  of truth for claude-code-status-line — config management, symlink, and upgrade spec.
  UPDATABLE_TOOLS derives from registered tools rather than a hardcoded list. cli.py uses target_id
  throughout with isinstance guards at MCP call sites.

Enables terminal_title.enabled: true in personal/work profiles for cross-machine-consistent terminal
  tab renaming.


## v0.39.0 (2026-04-23)

### Chores

- **release**: 0.39.0
  ([`e7de8f3`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/e7de8f33a5b901d0dc8bcbb49153afb52ec8506f))

### Documentation

- Update documentation to reflect multi-agent expansion
  ([`4562aeb`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/4562aeb4f92a07d329dfac02ab2f0ae3a24d338a))

README and AGENTS.md still described a 2-agent tool (Claude + Goose) despite the project supporting
  5 agents since v0.33. Three fully supported agents (Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Amp) were entirely
  absent from user-facing docs, along with MCP management, the three-tier profile hierarchy, and
  several CLI commands.

### Features

- **claude**: Enable verbose view mode for expanded tool output
  ([`70755ab`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/70755abbdd41d250dcd82301c18e5d299f971c88))

Fullscreen TUI collapses all tool call results by default, requiring click-to-expand on each one.
  viewMode "verbose" keeps them expanded in the live view without needing Ctrl+O transcript mode.


## v0.38.0 (2026-04-22)

### Bug Fixes

- Validate config values at serialization boundary
  ([`8bcc081`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/8bcc0817ee7ffc8d6b2f602f973c751008baaf5d))

Override values were never validated for format compatibility — None from any entry point (CLI,
  manual YAML edit, profile, config wizard) would silently flow through until tomli_w crashed with
  an uncaught TypeError during TOML serialization. Validation now runs inside dump_config_file() so
  all five entry points are covered by a single check, with a clear error message naming the
  offending key path.

- **codex**: Set plan mode reasoning effort in managed config
  ([`7bbce52`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/7bbce52a25ce03d74d01bcbee0b8d97ed84e3066))

Codex treats plan mode reasoning effort separately from the default model reasoning effort. Add the
  missing managed config key so Plan mode uses the same xhigh default shipped by ai-agent-rules.

### Chores

- **release**: 0.38.0
  ([`1c4de13`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/1c4de13ff68e44b2a1017504912817449c7f7aa4))

### Features

- **codex**: Add managed status line with correct list override semantics
  ([`1682fd4`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/1682fd4ffeb5527f4bee213ef2139ed8ffdbd322))

Codex added native footer customization via [tui].status_line in config.toml. This adds a bundled
  default that aligns with our Claude status line using only Codex's built-in footer items.

Fixed deep_merge to replace lists wholesale instead of merging element-by-element with trailing base
  elements preserved — the old behavior silently kept stale items when a shorter override list was
  intended to fully replace the base. This eliminates the need for any per-field replacement
  infrastructure.


## v0.37.0 (2026-04-22)

### Chores

- **release**: 0.37.0
  ([`06ea290`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/06ea290b30c0b64d80c3db6e74d73c954edd7364))

### Features

- Map Claude Code settings to Amp, Codex, Gemini, and Goose
  ([`9ad4a04`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/9ad4a04a5a7b0c937beba075bbcd2dc15ef28d88))

Claude Code has extensive config tuning (reasoning effort, tool permissions, session retention,
  attribution, telemetry). The other agents had minimal configuration. This maps each setting to its
  closest equivalent per upstream schema, validated against cached JSON schemas from the config
  validation framework.

Codex: reasoning effort/summary, history persistence, analytics,

attribution. Gemini: read-only tool allowlist with auto_edit mode, session retention, inline
  thinking. Goose: telemetry disabled. Amp: anthropic effort/thinking, deny permissions for
  destructive

ops, notifications. Work profile: Codex fast mode, Goose config excluded (MDM-managed).

### Testing

- Run schema validation in default suite
  ([`a60f6ed`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/a60f6eddbde96d8ddf8e15f1feb5709c71e940ca))

The schema checks were effectively dormant because the normal test path and CI skipped the live
  validation class. Run them from the default suite so schema drift shows up in the same place as
  the rest of the project's regressions.

Split deterministic schema fetcher coverage from integration-style config compatibility checks so
  the test layout matches the real boundary and Goose validation no longer rides along with the
  remote-fetch marker.


## v0.36.0 (2026-04-21)

### Chores

- **release**: 0.36.0
  ([`2252a01`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/2252a0182b86d96756d2f00546df00277a0923fe))

### Features

- Standardize on ai-agent-rules as canonical name, fix shell completions PATH shadowing
  ([`e2e1e67`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/e2e1e67bd190c23f99dca1d6110c4fc451160f00))

Shell completions hardcoded `ai-rules` as a bare command name in the eval line written to .zshrc.
  When Hermit installs a different `ai-rules` binary earlier on PATH, it shadows the Python CLI at
  shell startup — every new terminal in a Hermit-managed repo dumps Rust --help text through eval,
  producing a cascade of errors.

Replaced the hardcoded eval with shell-native completion aliasing: generates completions via
  `ai-agent-rules` (unshadowed by Hermit) with a `command -v` guard, then aliases the completion
  function to `ai-rules` via compdef/complete. Both commands get tab completion without hardcoded
  paths.

Broader naming standardization: `ai-agent-rules` is now the canonical name in all user-facing
  strings, tool IDs, config paths, and documentation. `ai-rules` remains as a CLI alias. Centralized
  path accessors (`get_user_config_path`, `get_state_dir`) handle lazy migration from old paths
  (`~/.ai-rules-config.yaml` → `~/.ai-agent-rules-config.yaml`, `~/.ai-rules/` →
  `~/.ai-agent-rules/`). MCP managed-by values use dual-read for backward compatibility. Fixed
  broken `willpfleger` GitHub URLs in pyproject.toml (username was never valid).

### Features

Add `showThinkingSummaries: true` to Claude settings so thinking blocks render as summaries instead
  of being omitted.

Replace the blanket `@pytest.mark.xfail` on the Claude schema test with an explicit allowlist of
  known SchemaStore false positives (`Read(*)`, `Skill(*)`). The test now collects all validation
  errors and only suppresses the specific known instances — any new schema violations surface as
  real failures.

Claude Code's system prompt now injects a `## Test plan` template into PR descriptions by default.
  The pr-creator skill already overrides this, but agents creating PRs via `gh pr create` or
  built-in flows bypass the skill. Adding the rule to AGENTS.md (always loaded) closes the gap.


## v0.33.0 (2026-04-21)

### Chores

- **release**: 0.33.0
  ([`8f8216f`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/8f8216f48ea5ffe6cc5532920bba25bd25a16c5c))

### Features

- Add amp as a managed agent
  ([`a5332c1`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/a5332c186236e098720dfdfadcf14a2280f99597))

Amp (ampcode.com) uses AGENTS.md for guidance and JSON settings at ~/.config/amp/settings.json with
  flat amp.*-prefixed keys. Base config maps Claude Code equivalents: thinking enabled, attribution
  disabled, xhigh reasoning effort. MCP servers managed under the amp.mcpServers key. Skills
  directory at ~/.config/agents/skills/ added to shared skills distribution.


## v0.32.0 (2026-04-17)

### Bug Fixes

- Codex exec non-TTY hang, cache activation for preserved_fields
  ([`95bc7cd`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/95bc7cdd8680c147825d851936198a2b37ee11c3))

codex exec hangs in non-TTY contexts (Claude Code's Bash tool) because it waits for stdin that never
  arrives. The ad37829 fix piped prompts via stdin, which worked but caused Codex to echo the full
  prompt to stderr. The OPENAI_API_KEY injection was also unnecessary — ChatGPT OAuth works when the
  configured model supports exec mode.

Fix: close stdin with < /dev/null and instruct Codex to cat the prompt file via its shell tool. Drop
  API key injection and key-file guard.

Separately, the cache system only activated when settings_overrides existed, but agents with
  preserved_fields (codex: projects, claude: hooks/plugins, goose: extensions, gemini: ide) need the
  cache as a write buffer even without overrides — otherwise the symlink points to the git-tracked
  source and the agent dirties the repo. Add Agent.needs_cache property and a force parameter on
  Config cache helpers so all four agents route through the cache unconditionally.

Also make the crossfire skill auto-execute by replacing the persona description with an imperative
  heading.

- Complete preserved_fields cache symmetry across all code paths
  ([`38a44cb`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/38a44cbf7c916f322d010ca959c305673a0d98b6))

The previous commit expanded cache creation to agents with preserved_fields, but three code paths
  still assumed "overrides = cache": cleanup_orphaned_cache deleted caches it shouldn't have, config
  show --merged skipped agents with preserved-field caches, and direct dict access on
  settings_overrides would KeyError for agents that only have preserved_fields.

Make cleanup_orphaned_cache require an explicit agents_needing_cache set (removes the unsafe
  settings_overrides-only fallback), fix config show --merged to detect cache files regardless of
  overrides, and guard dict accesses with .get().

- Remove invalid config keys caught by schema validation tests
  ([`613080a`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/613080a2c070cc37ddc79cea98f324fab17a8d6a))

Codex config.toml had `trust_level` at the top level, but it's a per-project key (nested under
  `projects` in the schema). Removed.

Claude settings.json had `Search(*)` in permissions.allow — `Search` is not a valid tool name, it
  was a no-op. Removed. `Skill(*)` and `Read(*)` are valid patterns kept as-is; the SchemaStore
  community schema's regex incorrectly rejects them (xfail in test).

Also excludes network-dependent schema tests from `just test` default run to prevent external schema
  drift from blocking local development.

### Chores

- **release**: 0.32.0
  ([`2f8dd93`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/2f8dd931ec6e3d31bddc9ee9f44645aab89afc73))

### Features

- Add personal profile and three-tier profile hierarchy
  ([`ada6554`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/ada6554f7a4e1c49bcaf47a7d12084aaef74236d))

Establishes default → personal → work inheritance chain. Default stays lean with cc-marketplace as
  the only bundled default. Personal extends default with preferred model (opusplan). Work extends
  personal with extended-context model overrides.

Cleans up personal artifacts that leaked into the base tier: removes unused beads/perles Bash
  permissions, removes plugin-dev plugin from default profile, genericizes personal username and org
  references in AGENTS.md examples. Removes vestigial enabledPlugins from base settings.json, dead
  is_enabled field from ToolSpec, and stale refactoring comment in config.py. Adds empty mcps.json
  so profile mcp_overrides can merge onto a base.

### Testing

- Add config validation and deep-merge regression test suite
  ([`5bc21e3`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/5bc21e365c9c84f41925807bb250f7df282e8a20))

Zero test coverage existed for deep_merge() through real agent config shapes, so profile inheritance
  could silently regress to shallow merge with no test failure. No test validated bundled config
  files are parseable or structurally correct either.

Adds 60 new tests across three layers: deep-merge through all four agents' config shapes (19 tests),
  structural validation of bundled configs and profiles (23 tests), and schema validation against
  provider JSON Schemas with offline-safe TTL cache (12 tests). Also moves test/lint deps (pytest,
  ruff, hatch, etc.) from runtime to dev dependency group where they belong.


## v0.31.5 (2026-04-15)

### Bug Fixes

- Make crossfire Codex invocation work with API key auth and stdin
  ([`ad37829`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/ad37829b4451be69335c56afa623410852ecdb16))

codex exec rejects ChatGPT OAuth for all models — setting OPENAI_API_KEY from ~/.env/openai.key
  switches the auth path. Prompt file instruction was unreliable (codex sometimes ran cat, sometimes
  hung for stdin) — piping via stdin is consistent. cd to REPO_ROOT before launching CLIs so
  Gemini's ImportProcessor doesn't emit ENOENT errors from submodule directories.

- Track profile-contributed hooks and deploy all hook scripts
  ([`3f667eb`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/3f667ebd26931623698cb49ea3fe340533835710))

ManagedFieldsTracker used base_settings (raw repo file) as the source of truth for PRESERVED_FIELDS
  contributions. Hooks added via profile settings_overrides were never tracked, so profile switches
  couldn't clean up stale entries. Now uses the merged settings and tracks on first install too.

Hook script deployment only symlinked .py files matching a regex. Shell scripts (.sh) in the hooks
  directory were silently ignored. Now deploys all files unconditionally -- settings and MCP config
  control which ones are actually invoked.

Also adds is_enabled callback to ToolSpec for profile-conditional tools.

### Chores

- **release**: 0.31.5
  ([`98a4a0b`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/98a4a0b2244ffb14edc5d68ebf6a72bc7e479fb1))

### Refactoring

- Move settings cache logic to Agent, make preserved fields agent-owned
  ([`ae73521`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/ae73521f6445d5ce3a9a226ccce487bcf8998316))

AGENT_CONFIG_METADATA in config.py duplicated data the agent classes already owned
  (config_file_name, config_file_format). Settings cache methods (build_merged_settings,
  is_cache_stale, get_cache_diff) took agent name strings and did internal lookups — but every
  caller already had an agent instance.

Moved cache methods to Agent base class where they read format and preserved_fields from self. Each
  agent subclass now declares which config fields are tool-managed (claude: enabledPlugins/hooks,
  codex: projects, gemini: ide, goose: extensions). Preservation logic lifted from JSON-only to all
  formats — fixes bogus stale-cache diffs for codex config.toml and goose config.yaml.

Deleted AGENT_CONFIG_METADATA and PRESERVED_FIELDS. Added AGENT_FORMATS and FORMAT_CONFIG_FILES for
  the few string-based lookups that remain (validate_override_path, config show). Made config I/O
  helpers public.

### Refactoring

- Extract multi-agent MCPManager from Claude-only implementation
  ([`63fcf4f`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/63fcf4f6b8dff161d45ddc260017e36fe7dbdd1d))

MCPManager was hardcoded to write only to ~/.claude.json. Refactored into an abstract base class
  with four agent-specific subclasses (Claude, Goose, Codex, Gemini), each translating a shared MCP
  definition format to the agent's native config (JSON, YAML, TOML). Agent base class gains
  get_mcp_manager() interface so the CLI can dispatch polymorphically instead of isinstance guards.


## v0.31.3 (2026-04-14)

### Bug Fixes

- Dev-docs PLAN files land in monorepo app dir, not monorepo root
  ([`0b80dc0`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/0b80dc06022a8146d9748a23ad508599fff08d08))

In monorepos the agent's CWD is <monorepo>/<app>/ but PLAN__ files were written to <monorepo>/ —
  invisible when the IDE opens at the app level. Introduces a {project_root} variable that combines
  --git-common-dir (worktree-safe repo root) with --show-toplevel (working tree root) to compute the
  correct target for all four scenarios: standard repo, worktree, monorepo, and worktree+monorepo.

## v0.31.2 (2026-04-14)

### Bug Fixes

- Harden crossfire CLI orchestration for reliability and concurrency
  ([`9a97595`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/9a975959f029ece090d2755c60ca5095dea3d7aa))

Gemini crashed scanning all of /tmp when given --include-directories /tmp, Codex produced
  false-negative "unavailable" results from nvm stderr noise, and neither CLI had timeout
  protection. Fixed by isolating prompt files in unique mktemp -d subdirectories, separating Codex
  stderr, adding timeout 300, and switching from temp-file-based result passing to inline delimited
  output with trap EXIT cleanup.

Coordinator prompt teaches claude-lead how to use Sprout MCP tools (threading, @mentioning, polling)
  and when to engage reviewer agents vs respond directly. Reviewer prompt ports the crossfire review
  format (CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/MINOR) for codex/goose agents that don't have Claude's crossfire skill.


## v0.30.1 (2026-04-07)

### Bug Fixes

- Disable adaptive thinking and hardcode max effort
  ([`f35e8f2`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/f35e8f2526596472a938fb1ea8303ffdc3433b9e))

Adaptive thinking has an acknowledged bug where it under-allocates reasoning on turns it misjudges
  as simple, producing zero-reasoning responses that fabricate or take shortcuts — even at
  effort=high. Combined with the medium effort default (Mar 3), this matches the configuration
  identified in anthropics/claude-code#42796 as causing a 70% drop in read:edit ratio and 12x
  increase in user corrections.

Forces fixed thinking budget and max effort via env vars in base settings.json, which all profiles
  inherit via deep merge. Intended as a temporary measure until Anthropic resolves the adaptive
  thinking under-allocation bug.

### Features

- Parallelize crossfire CLI launches with Claude's own review
  ([`b46a162`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/b46a16258432592dbb5d91d2bba8d55e2f8af7fb))

Crossfire CLIs (Codex/Gemini) only need the diff to run their review, not Claude's findings.
  Launching them in Phase 5 after Phases 1-4 wasted 1-3 minutes of wall-clock time. Now Phase 0
  fires the CLIs via Bash(run_in_background=true) immediately after diff gathering, and Phase 5 just
  reads the pre-launched results.

Also drops "Primary reviewer findings" from the crossfire prompt -- external models now review
  independently without anchoring bias, matching the standalone crossfire skill's behavior.


## v0.29.0 (2026-04-01)

### Chores

### Features

- Consolidate crossfire agent into self-contained skills
  ([`ff9d5e7`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/ff9d5e78f75f595de49c5f48dd5bee241f3b6326))

The crossfire system had three components that didn't connect: a skill dispatcher, a code-reviewer
  integration, and a custom agent definition with all the CLI orchestration logic. The agent was
  unreachable in practice — subagents can't spawn other subagents, and neither skill had
  context:fork, so agent:general-purpose was a no-op.

Merged the agent's orchestration (CLI availability checks, temp file handling, parallel codex/gemini
  execution, consensus synthesis) into both skills directly. Added context:fork to code-reviewer so
  it runs isolated and model:opus actually takes effect. Fixed mktemp template that failed on macOS
  BSD (suffix after X pattern) and added gemini API key presence to the availability check.

## v0.3.0 (2025-12-01)

### Bug Fixes

- Address critical code review issues
  ([`8b97673`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/8b976730ce1ca41c9e7c3cf5a69594baf457bd6f))

This commit fixes the critical and high-priority issues identified in the code review:

Critical Fixes: - Fix deep merge shallow copy bug - Use copy.deepcopy() instead of base.copy() to
  prevent mutation of base dictionaries (CRITICAL) - Add nested key support to override unset
  command - Now matches override set functionality for consistency

High-Priority Fixes: - Add cache invalidation/staleness detection - Cache is now checked against
  base settings and user config modification times - Optimize cache rebuilding - Cache only built
  during install, not on every get_symlinks() call (status checks are now read-only)

Technical Changes: - Added is_cache_stale() method to check if cache needs rebuilding - Added
  get_settings_file_for_symlink() for read-only symlink enumeration - Modified
  build_merged_settings() to skip rebuild when cache is fresh - Added force_rebuild parameter to
  build_merged_settings() - Cache building moved to install command, before symlink creation - Added
  7 new tests for cache invalidation logic

Test Results: - All 30 tests passing (23 original + 7 new) - Tests cover cache staleness detection,
  force rebuild, and file selection

Performance Impact: - Status/diff commands no longer rebuild cache unnecessarily - Cache
  automatically invalidates when base settings or overrides change - --rebuild-cache flag forces
  cache rebuild when needed

### Chores

- Couple more CC perms

  ([`ee6dbeb`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/ee6dbeb0d47932a12d1867a7b756b2b0c0938073))

### Features

- Improve exclusion config UX and add settings merge functionality
  ([`673057a`](https://github.com/wpfleger96/ai-agent-rules/commit/673057a8c5278ed913d698deaf11482f4a447737))

This commit significantly improves the user experience for managing exclusions and adds powerful
  settings override capabilities for machine-specific configurations.

Major Features: - Glob pattern support for exclusions (e.g., ~/.claude/*.json) - Settings overrides
  for machine-specific settings with deep merge - Interactive config wizard (ai-rules config init) -
  New CLI command groups: exclude, override, config - Settings cache management with --rebuild-cache
  flag

CLI Improvements: - ai-rules config init: Interactive wizard for first-time setup - ai-rules config
  show: View raw or merged settings - ai-rules config edit: Edit config in $EDITOR - ai-rules
  exclude add/remove/list: Manage exclusions - ai-rules override set/unset/list: Manage settings
  overrides

Settings Merge System: - Sync base settings.json via git - Override specific keys per machine (e.g.,
  model access) - Deep merge with caching in ~/.ai-rules/cache/ - Supports different settings across
  work/personal laptops

Technical Changes: - Added fnmatch for glob pattern matching in config.py - Implemented deep merge
  algorithm for settings - Added build_merged_settings() for cache management - Enhanced ClaudeAgent
  to use merged settings - Added 16 new tests covering glob patterns and merging

Documentation: - Comprehensive README updates with examples - Updated .ai-rules-config.yaml.example
  with detailed comments - Added troubleshooting section - Documented config precedence and merging
  behavior - Updated CHANGELOG.md

All tests passing (23 tests).
