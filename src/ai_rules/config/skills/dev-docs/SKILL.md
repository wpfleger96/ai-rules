## Context

- Project: !`git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_IN_GIT_REPO"`
- PLAN files: !`sh -c 'PROJECT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null); if [ -z "$PROJECT_ROOT" ]; then echo "NOT_IN_GIT_REPO"; exit 0; fi; cd "$PROJECT_ROOT" && for f in PLAN__*.md; do [ -f "$f" ] && echo "$f" && found=1; done; if [ -z "$found" ]; then [ -f PLAN.md ] && echo "LEGACY_PLAN" || echo "NO_PLAN_FILES"; fi' 2>/dev/null | sed 's/PLAN__//;s/\.md$//' | paste -sd ',' -`
- Directory: !`pwd`
- Last commit: !`git log -1 --format="%h %ai %s" 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_COMMITS"`

# Create or Update Development Documentation

Automatically creates task-specific PLAN files (`PLAN__<TASK>.md`) or updates existing ones by analyzing session activity to track implementation progress.

## Task-Specific PLAN Files

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for plans and progress across sessions. A new agent must be able to resume work using ONLY the PLAN file -- no prior session context, no codebase re-exploration for decisions already made.

**Naming Convention:**
- Format: `PLAN__<TASK>.md` (always `PLAN__` with two underscores)
- Task identifier: 1-2 words, uppercase letters only, single underscores between words
- Valid: ✓ `AUTH_FLOW`, ✓ `API_MIGRATION`, ✓ `SLACK_FORMATTING`
- Invalid: ✗ `auth_flow` (lowercase), ✗ `AUTH__FLOW` (double underscore)

## CRITICAL: File Location

**ALWAYS write PLAN files to the git repository root, NEVER to ~/.claude/plans/**

- Target path: `{git_root}/PLAN__<TASK>.md`
- Claude Code's `~/.claude/plans/` is separate and unrelated
- The `/dev-docs` command manages repository-local documentation

## Phase 1: Determine Mode

Use pre-executed context:

**Check "PLAN files":**
- `NO_PLAN_FILES` → **Create mode**: Extract plan from ExitPlanMode
- `LEGACY_PLAN` → **Legacy migration**: Rename PLAN.md to PLAN__<TASK>.md
- Single task → **Update mode**: Work with that file
- Multiple tasks → **Disambiguate**: Determine which task or create new

## Phase 2: Extract Plan & Evidence

### For Create Mode

⚠️ **ANTI-RECENCY BIAS**: Recent work dominates attention. The FIRST ExitPlanMode has the complete vision. Document ALL work (completed, current, AND future).

**Extract plans:**
1. Find ALL ExitPlanMode calls in session
2. Extract each in chronological order
3. **CRITICAL**: Read FIRST call for complete vision
4. **PRESERVE original structure** - match original organization
5. Synthesize complete plan ensuring ALL items captured
6. Generate task name from main theme

**Search for implementation evidence:**
1. Review activity after last ExitPlanMode
2. Find: Write/Edit/Bash/TodoWrite calls, completion phrases
3. Map tasks to evidence via file paths and keywords

**Assign statuses:**
- Strong evidence → [DONE]
- Medium evidence → [IN PROGRESS]
- Weak/no evidence → [TODO]

### For Update Mode

1. Read `PLAN__<TASK>.md`, parse task hierarchy with statuses
2. Search recent activity for implementation evidence
3. Match tasks to evidence, assign status updates
4. Check for plan evolution: ExitPlanMode newer than PLAN file

## Phase 3: Write or Update File

See `references/templates.md` for PLAN.md structure.

### Create Mode

Generate PLAN__<TASK>.md with:
- Overview: 1-2 paragraph summary including architectural approach and key design decisions (with reasoning)
- Scope: Features, components, files with role descriptions (what each file does in context of this plan)
- Purpose: Problem, value, requirements, and relevant constraints or limitations discovered
- Implementation Details: Hierarchical tasks with [STATUS], each containing enough detail for a new agent to implement without re-exploring the codebase (include HOW, not just WHAT)

Write to `{git_root}/PLAN__<TASK>.md` and **validate**:
- Compare structure to FIRST ExitPlanMode
- Count items: original N items should match generated
- Future work documented as [TODO], not omitted
- Task name format valid

### Update Mode

Update `PLAN__<TASK>.md`:
- Use Edit tool for each status change
- Match exact old_string with indentation
- Preserve hierarchy and formatting

Handle plan evolution if detected:
- Add new areas to existing structure
- Mark deprecated as `[CANCELLED - plan changed]`
- Update Scope/Purpose if changed

## Cold-Start Resumption Requirement

Every PLAN file must be self-contained enough for a new agent to resume work without prior session context. When writing or updating, verify:

- **Architectural context**: Key design decisions and WHY they were made (not just what was chosen, but what was rejected and why)
- **Task detail**: Each [TODO] task describes HOW to implement, not just WHAT to implement -- include approach, relevant patterns, and target file paths
- **Dependencies**: Tasks that must be completed in order are explicitly noted (e.g., "depends on Phase 1 completing" or "must run after database migration")
- **Gotchas**: Any pitfalls, constraints, or non-obvious behaviors discovered during implementation are captured in the Gotchas section with enough detail to avoid re-discovery
- **File roles**: The Scope section explains what each file does in the context of this plan, not just that it was modified

## Status Transitions & Evidence Strength

**Evidence Strength:**
- Strong: Multiple indicators → [DONE]
- Medium: Single indicator → [IN PROGRESS]
- Weak/None → [TODO]

**Valid Status Labels:**
- [TODO] → Not started
- [IN PROGRESS] → Started not finished
- [DONE] → Completed
- [BLOCKED] → Cannot proceed (include reason)
- [CANCELLED - plan changed] → No longer relevant

## Critical Requirements

**All Modes:**
- Analyze session activity for evidence
- Match ALL tasks to evidence, assign statuses intelligently
- Include evidence-free tasks as [TODO] - never skip planned work
- Use 3-space indentation, preserve hierarchy
- Verify PLAN file passes cold-start test: could a new agent resume work using only this file?

**Create Mode:**
- **PREVENT RECENCY BIAS**: Prioritize FIRST ExitPlanMode
- **PRESERVE STRUCTURE**: Match original organization exactly
- Document entire plan regardless of progress
- Generate valid task name, create in git root (NEVER ~/.claude/plans/)

**Update Mode:**
- Use Edit tool with exact matching
- Handle evolution: add new, mark deprecated as cancelled

See `references/templates.md` for detailed PLAN.md structure and examples.
